This repository contains the open-source code used for the paper" On the Significance of Intermediate Latents:
Distinguishing Quantum Causal Scenarios with Indistinguishable Classical Analogs" by D.Centeno and E.Wolfe.

There is the Semidefinite Program (SDP_manuscript) used to compute different bounds for the inequality given in the manuscript (Eq.3)
in the extended Bell scenario with an intermediate node between AC or BC.
You can also find a copy of the inflation package (https://github.com/ecboghiu/inflation) used to implement the SDP.
